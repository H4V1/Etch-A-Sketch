# Etch-A-Sketch

This project was made with the intention of practicing everything learn so far about HTML, CSS and JavaScript in The Odin Project.

The thing that was focused the more in this project was the DOM manipulation (as intended for this part of TOP curriculum).

The learnings from doing this project were pretty much a better understanding on how the DOM works, a bit of JS practice, and one of the new things i learned was to use variables between JS and CSS. And also i felt that i'm having a better git workflow, of course still need to work on commit messages.

The las thing mentioned is because i was having issues with the grid not adjusting properly. First i used flexbox since i'm more familiar with it than grid, in the end i was easier to use grid, that way i could pass a variable for the amount of columns based on the user input.

## Add next to the project

- A proper UI
- An option to clear the grid
- An option to pick diferent colors
- Add a scroll bar to adjust the grid size (this one is taken from other TOP students)
